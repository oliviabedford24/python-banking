# python-challenge

This is a two-part project that analyzes profit and losses for a bank, and the results from an election for political office. The code is contained in the main.py files for each folder, and the analysis/output are contained in text files in the "analysis" folders for PyBank and PyPoll.

This code was written in Python VS Code and should be run in the same environment for optimal results.

The code written here is my original work.

Thanks!
